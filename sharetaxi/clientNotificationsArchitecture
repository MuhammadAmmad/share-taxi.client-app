driver client sends request to server containing <driverID,latitude,longitude>
server sends push notifications to all passenger clients

1. passenger client sends polling of <id,ip> to GCM (done automatically)
2. driver client sends <id,location> to server
3. server sends notification or <id,location> (if<4KB) to to GCM
4. GCM sends notification or <id,location> (if<4KB) to passenger clients

if passengers got notifications (not in our scenario):
5.  they send reques to server
6. server sends data to passenger
